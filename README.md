CineMundo Project:
Project Overview:
 - CineMundo is a comprehensive web platform for selling movie tickets, developed as a school project. The application is designed to be intuitive and functional, allowing users to view showtimes, get detailed information about films, and securely purchase tickets.

The project is divided into two main areas:

 - Commercial Area (Frontend)
 - Film Showcase: Display of movies currently in theaters with complete information (synopsis, cast, director, genre, duration, and classification).
 - Showtime Search: Allows users to find movie sessions by date and cinema location.
 - User Registration: A registration system so customers can manage their purchases.
 - Ticket Purchase: A process for selecting and buying tickets with various payment options.
 - Email Confirmation: After a purchase, an email is sent to the user with all the order details.
 - Administrative Area (Backend)
 - Registration Management: Administration of films, sessions, and cinemas.
